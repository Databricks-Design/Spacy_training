## 📊 Executive Data Summary: Transaction Entity Model

### 1. Dataset Health (Volume & Quality)
**The Stat:** 265,977 total transactions.
* **82%** contain usable data (Signal).
* **18%** are empty/junk text (Noise).

> **Stakeholder Significance:**
> This is a **healthy, high-volume dataset**. The 18% "junk" data is actually valuable—it serves as "Negative Sampling," teaching the model to stay quiet when it sees irrelevant text (reducing False Positives).

---

### 2. Complexity & Architecture (The Overlap Issue)
**The Stat:** **0.95%** of transactions (2,053 rows) contain conflicting/overlapping labels.
* **Main Culprit:** `BUSINESS` vs `LOCATION` (e.g., "Dominos NY" where "NY" is both part of the business name and a location).

> **Stakeholder Significance:**
> While 1% seems small, these are often the most critical/complex transactions. Because of this, we **cannot use standard NER**. We must use **SpanCat (Span Categorization)** architecture to ensure we don't drop these details.

---

### 3. Model Configuration (The "Net Size")
**The Stat:** **99.6%** of all entities are between **1 and 7 words** long.
* Most entities (90%) are short (1-3 words).
* The "Long Tail" (descriptions, long business names) caps out at 7 words.

> **Stakeholder Significance:**
> We have precise boundaries for the model. We will configure the model to scan for patterns up to **7 words long**. This maximizes accuracy without wasting computing power on impossibly long phrases.

---

### 4. Risk Assessment (Bias & Imbalance)
**The Stat:** Extreme imbalance between common and rare types.
* **Dominant:** `BUSINESS` (209k examples) & `LOCATION` (115k).
* **At Risk:** `MARKETPLACE` (only **259** examples).

> **Stakeholder Significance:**
> **High Risk of Bias.** The model will learn `BUSINESS` perfectly but will likely ignore `MARKETPLACE` entirely because it is statistically insignificant (0.1% of data).
> **Action Required:** We must artificially boost ("upsample") the Marketplace data, or the model will fail to detect it.

## EDA SUMMARY FOR STAKEHOLDERS

**Dataset Overview:**
- Training: 265,977 transactions
- Validation: 28,214 transactions

**Entity Coverage:**
- 82% of transactions contain labeled entities
- 18% have zero entities (negative examples)
- Average: 1.8 entities per transaction

**Transaction Distribution by Entity Count:**
- 0 entities: 48,822 transactions (18%)
- 1 entity: 77,774 transactions (29%)
- 2 entities: 94,648 transactions (36%)
- 3 entities: 29,651 transactions (11%)
- 4+ entities: 15,082 transactions (6%)

**Data Quality:**
- ✓ 76% of transactions have 1-3 entities (good density)
- ✓ Most entities are 1-3 words long (easy to detect)
- ✓ 18% empty transactions provide negative training examples

**Entity Type Distribution:**
- BUSINESS: 209,454 (50%) - Most common
- LOCATION: 115,677 (28%)
- PAYMENT_TYPE: 35,439 (9%)
- DIGITAL_WALLET: 14,712 (4%)
- PAYMENT_PROCESSOR: 11,727 (3%)
- FINANCIAL_INSTITUTION: 11,675 (3%)
- PERSON: 6,948 (2%)
- PLATFORM: 4,646 (1%)
- DELIVERY_SERVICE: 3,096 (1%)
- BNPL_PROVIDER: 2,876 (1%)
- PAYMENT_NETWORK: 2,487 (1%)
- MARKETPLACE: 259 (<1%)

**Key Findings:**

1. **Entity Coverage is Good**
   - 82% labeled transactions is strong for NER training
   - 18% empty transactions help reduce false positives

2. **Data Distribution is Reasonable**
   - Most transactions (76%) have 1-3 entities
   - Very few complex transactions (>4 entities)

3. **Overlapping Entities Found**
   - 2,053 transactions (0.95%) have overlapping entity spans
   - Most common: BUSINESS overlaps with LOCATION (520 cases)

4. **Class Imbalance Present**
   - BUSINESS dominates at 50% of all entities
   - MARKETPLACE is rare with only 259 examples (0.1%)
   - May need special handling for rare entity types

**Recommendations:**
✓ Dataset is ready for model training
✓ Consider upsampling or monitoring performance for MARKETPLACE
✓ Handle overlapping entities appropriately in model architecture
